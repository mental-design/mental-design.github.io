Basically A Sans Serif (BASS) is a monolinear geometric sans serif typeface designed for display use.
For BASS, we took the design guidelines and the drawing code of [Basically A Mono][2] (BAM) and applied it to a display sans serif. As a result BASS also has very precise geometry.
While inspired by geometric sans serifs such as ITC Avant Garde Gothic and Futura, we designed BASS to have balanced proportions, closer to recent typefaces like Gotham and Gilroy.
BASS is designed for display use, but it also works well in logos due to the extremely geometric nature of the typeface.
