Basically A Sans Serif (BASS) is a monolinear geometric sans serif typeface designed for display use.
It takes the design guidelines of [Basically A Mono][2] (BAM) and applies it to a display sans serif. We adapted the drawing library from BAM and extended the spacing code. BASS also uses the Fibonacci Series as a guideline for tuning the glyph parameters, naturally guiding the balance towards the golden ratio.
