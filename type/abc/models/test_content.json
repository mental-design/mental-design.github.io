    "text": "Both estimates happily coincided with Spiveyʼs sense of the market, and he took to saying, with obvious pleasure, “We have two hundred shovels for four hundred ditch diggers.” But what to charge for each shovel? “It was really a total wet finger in the air,” says Brennan Carley, who had worked closely with a lot of high-speed traders, and who had been hired by Spivey to sell his network to them. “All of us were just guessing.” The number they came up with was $300,000 a month, roughly ten times the price of the existing telecom lines. The first two hundred stock market players willing to pay in advance and sign a five-year lease would get a deal: $10.6 million for five years. The traders who leased Spreadʼs line would also need to buy and maintain their own signal amplifiers, housed in thirteen amp sites along Spreadʼs route. All-in, the up-front cost to each of the two hundred traders would come to about $14 million, or a grand total of $2.8 billion."
