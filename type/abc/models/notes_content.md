All Birds Combinations (ABC) is a modular display typeface often categorized as a stencil typeface.
It is a reinterpretation of Josef Albersʼ Kombinations-Schrift, where the name is also derived from.

Albersʼ Kombinations-schrift was created for the age of industry and mass production. The typeface was created by combining the 10 shapes above—which could be mass produced in glass, plastic, metal or wood—and could be easily assembled anywhere.

For ABC, we wanted to translate Kombinations-Schrift into a typeface of the information age, a product of data, algorithms, and software programming. The key insight was to encode each glyph into an array of numbers based on the basic shapes used to create it—square, circle, and quarter circle. We then implemented a decoder program that could take the array of numbers and create a font.

With the decoder in place, modifying a glyph was just a matter of changing numbers. Whereas Kombinations-Schrift has a Fraktur like quality, each glyph in ABC was revised to resemble neoclassical type, such as Didot or Bodoni. The high contrast and vertical axis of Didone typefaces makes a good reference for a strongly vertical typeface like ABC.

The design space of the typeface could be extend by adding new functionality to the decoder as needed. New parts, such as semi-circles for rings and triangles for bird beaks, were added as needed. Compressed weights could be created systematically by defining how to decode each number for different dimensions. This systematic approach makes the changes between the weights smooth and continuous, allowing for seamless mix-and-matching like the examples below.
