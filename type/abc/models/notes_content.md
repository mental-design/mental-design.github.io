All Birds Combined (ABC) is a grid-based modular display typeface that is a reinterpretation of Josef Albers º Kombinations-schrift.

Kombinations-schrift was created using 10 different shapes, making it a modular/stencil typeface. The shapes were systematically created and thus the resulting letters can also be systematically decomposed.

For ABC, we initially split the glyphs following a grid (loosely in the spirit of Wim Crouwel). By viewing the glyphs this way, we can decompose or rather encode each letter into a simple array of numbers. Once a composer/decoder was implemented, we could adjust the glyphs by simply changing the position or the component type. New components could also be added if needed.
