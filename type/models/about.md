## Design at the intersection of typography, visual perception, and software engineering.

At Mental Design, the design process of a typeface starts with a concept, an abstract idea about how to decompose/compose letters. The concept is encoded into components which are programmatically translated into shapes, paths, and points. These components are then combined to create each glyph. No point is manipulated directly, rather each glyph is adjusted by parameters that change the settings for each component. The parameters are tuned along a grid system which guides the proportions then iteratively adjusted to make the characters fit together harmoniously. This systematic design approach reduces arbitrary artifacts and gives the typeface a coherent look and feel.

Hyung-Suk is a type designer that lives in the Bay Area. He designed his first font with a font editor that he programmed for a homework in the introduction to computer graphics class at Stanford. He previously worked at Apple and Shazam (before it was acquired by Apple) on audio signal processing and machine learning. He has a doctorate in electrical engineering on audio perception and signal processing from the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University. He also has a masters degree in image systems from the department of electrical engineering at Stanford.
