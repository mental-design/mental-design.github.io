## Type Design guided by Visual Perception, shaped with Software Engineering.

At Mental Design, the design process of a typeface starts with a concept, an abstract idea about how to analyze and synthesize letters. The concept is encoded into components which are programmatically translated into shapes, paths, and points. These components are then combined to create each glyph. No point is manipulated directly, rather each glyph is adjusted by parameters that change the settings for each component. The parameters are tuned along a grid system which guides the proportions, then iteratively adjusted to make the characters fit together harmoniously. This systematic design approach reduces arbitrary artifacts and gives the typeface a coherent look and feel.

## Chief Vision Officer | Head of Research & (Mental) Development | Lead Implementor

Hyung-Suk is a type designer that lives in the Bay Area. He created his first font with a font editor that he programmed for a homework in the introduction to computer graphics class at Stanford. He has a masters degree in image systems from the department of electrical engineering at Stanford where he studied computer graphics, data visualization and human computer interaction. He also has a doctorate in electrical engineering on audio perception and signal processing from the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University. He previously worked at Apple and Shazam (before it was acquired by Apple) on audio signal processing and machine learning.

<!-- If the job title piqued your interest (and you found this file), yes, this is currently a one person operation so I did everything - from type design, web design to writing the drawing library, the rendering pipeline and programming all components of the webpage. Vertical integration in its purest form. But I am not a do-it-all tyrant, or at least I don't think I am. If you want to collaborate, contact me at type@mentallydesigned.com. Many friends and previous colleagues say that I am nice, and my 2 cats think so too. ;-) -->
