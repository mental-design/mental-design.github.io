## Working at the intersection of type design, visual perception, and software engineering.

At Mental Design we take an analytical and systematic approach to type design. The design process of a typeface starts with a concept that is encoded into components that are then combined to create each glyph. No point is manipulated directly, rather each glyph is adjusted by parameters that translates the concept into shapes, paths, and points. 
The parameters for the components are tuned for each glyph to ensure they work together. This enables a systematic approach to type design.

## Chief Vision Officer | Lead Enabler | Head of (Mental) Development 

Hyung-Suk is a type designer that lives in the Bay Area. He designed his first typeface as a homework for a computer graphics introduction class at Stanford where he programmed the software used to create the font. He previously worked at Apple and Shazam (before it was acquired by the former) on audio signal processing and machine learning. He has a doctorate in electrical engineering on audio perception and signal processing from CCRMA at Stanford University.
