Basically A Mono (BAM) is a geometric monoline monospaced typeface primarily designed for code.
<!-- Motivation -->The main motivation for designing BAM was to have a visually uniform typeface to reduce clutter. Basic guidelines were set to achieve the goals:

1) Use lines with uniformly thickness. (No line modulation.)
2) Use lines and circles to form the letters.
3) Terminals should be horizontal or vertical.

These guidelines were followed until there was a good reason for adjustments, usually to improve legibility.
The typeface itself is created from code, instead of font design software, resulting in a very precisely engineered look. While each glyph was constructed from geometric components, the parameters were tuned along a grid system created using the Fibonacci Series, especially around 8, 13, and 21. This naturally pushes the balance of the glyphs towards the golden ratio.
