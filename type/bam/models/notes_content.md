Basically A Mono (BAM) is a geometric monolinear and monospaced typeface primarily designed for code.
<!-- Motivation -->The motivation for designing BAM was to create a typeface that had an organized look befit to code and software engineering where organization, of code, functions, data, files, etc., is of key importance. We sought to achieve an organized look through basic geometry and clear simple design guidelines:

- Use lines and circles to form the letters.
- Use lines with uniformly thickness. (No line modulation.)
- Terminals should be horizontal or vertical.

These guidelines were followed until there was a good reason for adjustments, usually to improve legibility.
The typeface itself is created from custom code, instead of font design software, resulting in a very precise systematically engineered result.

The whole design of BAM revolves around the optimally circular lowercase o. From a type design view point, BAM is a test of extreme geometry, the brutalist approach. Against the general discouragement of using circles in type design, we wanted to experiment and see what extreme geometry results in. 

While the lines and curves of the typeface is very geometric, the underlying shape is dictated by the stroke. Thus the geometry is used to support the stroke and not for geometry itself.

The parameters of the geometric components were tuned using ratios created using the Fibonacci Series, especially around 8, 13, and 21. This naturally pushes the ratios towards the golden ratio giving the typeface a natural balance.

### <span class="mono ss00">a</span> & <span class="mono ss01">a</span>
BAM provides both single story and double story lowercase a glyphs. The single story a befits the simplicity of the approach and fits display uses. That said, we understand the importance of being able to differentiate between **a** and **o** especially when reading and writing code, which is why we provide the double story a as default. As Bringhurst mentions, the text comes first, and for code we believe readability and correctness comes first.
