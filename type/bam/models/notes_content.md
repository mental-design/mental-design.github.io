<strong>Basically A Mono (BAM)</strong> is a **monospaced** and **monolinear** typeface constructed from basic geometric components - lines and circles. To sum it up, it's basically a mono! (bam!)

The motivation for designing BAM was to create a typeface that had a clean and organized look befit for coding and software engineering where organization of code, functions, data, files, etc., is of key importance. The typeface is developed using custom drawing code rather than font design software. 
Each point, line, curve is calculated and no point is manipulated manually. 
The result is a typeface with very precise geometry.

BAM provides both single story <span class='bam notes-sample ss01'>a</span> and double story lowercase <span class='bam notes-sample ss00'>a</span> via stylistic sets.
The single story <span class='bam notes-sample ss01'>a</span> fits the overall minimalist idea of BAM and is recommended for print or display use. However, we understand the importance of being able to differentiate between **a** and **o**, especially when reading and writing code, which is why we provide the double story <span class='bam notes-sample ss00'>a</span> as the default. So you can be sure it's "<strong class="bam ss00">Yes, I can.</strong>" and not "<strong class="bam">Yes, I con.</strong>"
